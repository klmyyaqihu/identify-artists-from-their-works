## Folder 4: image style transfer
* `image-style-change`: (This part we got inspiration and learning from https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/style-transfer-deep-learning-algorithm) First, we have an original image and a style image. Then, we still use VGG16 but only pick the convolution layers for extracting image's features and delete the layers for classification. Finally, we will get a new picture combine the style of the style image and the objects from original image.
* `image-style-change (another example)`: This part has the same codes with 'image-style-change' but using a different orignal image and a style image.
